what is self variable?
     In Python, the self variable is just a conventionally used name for the reference to the current instance (object) of the        class. When you create an object from a class, Python automatically passes that object as the first argument to any              instance method you call. By convention, we call that first parameter self.
     self represents "this object".It lets you access the attributes and methods of the object inside the class.
